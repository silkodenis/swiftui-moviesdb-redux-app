This is a demo app showcasing some of my Swift packages: Combine Networking, Combine Redux Store, and Navigation Coordinator. The app leverages a unidirectional data flow approach with state-driven side effects, providing a reactive and declarative way to build iOS applications.

## Key Components

- [Combine Redux Store](https://github.com/silkodenis/combine-redux-store): Manages application state and actions, ensuring predictable state transitions.
- [Combine Networking](https://github.com/silkodenis/swift-combine-networking): Handles all network requests to the MoviesDB API.
- [Navigation Coordinator](https://github.com/silkodenis/swiftui-navigation-coordinator): Manages navigation within the app, coordinating between different views.
