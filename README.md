# MoviesDB SwiftUI-Redux App

The MoviesDB SwiftUI App is a demonstration application showcasing the use of several of my Swift packages: `Combine Networking`, `Combine Redux Store`, and `Navigation Coordinator` Pattern. The app leverages a unidirectional data flow approach with a centralized app state and state-driven side effects, providing a reactive and declarative way to build iOS applications.

## Key Components

- [Combine Redux Store](https://github.com/silkodenis/combine-redux-store): Manages application state and actions, ensuring predictable state transitions.
- [Combine Networking](https://github.com/silkodenis/swift-combine-networking): Handles all network requests to the MoviesDB API.
- [Navigation Coordinator](https://github.com/silkodenis/swiftui-navigation-coordinator): Manages navigation within the app, coordinating between different views.
